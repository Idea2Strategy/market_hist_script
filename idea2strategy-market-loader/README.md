# Idea2Strategy historical market loader

This directory is a new, standalone Python 3.12 project. It does not import or copy
the legacy code in the parent `market_hist_script` repository.

It collects Alpaca SIP 30-minute bars for explicit `[start, end)` date ranges,
filters them to XNYS regular sessions, derives 1-hour, 4-hour, and daily bars, writes
fixed-schema Parquet shards, uploads immutable versioned S3 objects, and registers
only verified manifests in PostgreSQL. RDS `AVAILABLE` manifests—not S3 listings—
are the authoritative data catalog.

## Install

Install `uv`, then create the locked environment:

```powershell
uv sync --frozen --all-groups
uv run market-loader --help
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set credentials locally. Copy
`config.example.yaml` to `config.yaml`. Neither file should contain long-lived AWS
access keys. AWS access uses the named CLI profile; private RDS access uses the SSM
port-forwarding script and `sslmode=verify-full`.

Build a loader universe from the repository's ten-year S&P 500 history and enabled
ETF sources. The command resolves Alpaca symbols and primary exchanges through the
read-only Assets API and refuses to write the final CSV if any symbol is unresolved.

```powershell
uv run market-loader build-universe `
  --stocks ..\ticker_info\sp500_tickers_10years.txt `
  --etfs ..\ticker_info\etf_universe.csv `
  --overrides ..\ticker_info\historical_asset_overrides.csv `
  --output .\universe.csv `
  --start 2016-01-01
```

The reviewed override file supplies the former primary exchange only for historical
symbols that the current Alpaca Assets API no longer resolves. Each overridden or
inactive symbol must also return at least one exact-symbol historical SIP bar.
The latest returned session date becomes `effective_to`; no missing symbol is
silently omitted.

Apply `db/migration/V001__market_data_initial_schema.sql` through the deployment
Flyway process before executing any write command. The `market_loader` login role
must already exist; V001 grants it only the runtime schema and table privileges it
needs. Run Flyway with the deployment or master account, never with
`market_loader`. The loader never applies DDL.

## Safe workflow

All write commands are dry-run unless `--execute` is present.

```powershell
uv run market-loader doctor --config .\config.yaml

uv run market-loader plan `
  --config .\config.yaml `
  --universe .\universe.csv `
  --start 2024-01-01 --end 2025-01-01

uv run market-loader seed-catalog `
  --config .\config.yaml `
  --universe .\universe.csv

uv run market-loader seed-catalog `
  --config .\config.yaml `
  --universe .\universe.csv `
  --execute
```

The first write must be a sample of no more than five instruments and one year:

```powershell
uv run market-loader backfill `
  --config .\config.yaml `
  --universe .\universe.csv `
  --start 2024-01-01 --end 2025-01-01 `
  --max-symbols 5 `
  --execute
```

A larger write is blocked until that successful sample is recorded in RDS.
`PROVIDER_RIGHTS_APPROVED=true` and a non-empty
`PROVIDER_RIGHTS_VERSION` are also mandatory.

```powershell
uv run market-loader resume <run-uuid> --config .\config.yaml --execute
uv run market-loader validate --run-id <run-uuid>
uv run market-loader reconcile <run-uuid>
uv run market-loader status --run-id <run-uuid>
```

The application processes one calendar year at a time and splits API calls into
at most 180-day chunks and configured symbol batches. It never loads all ten years
into one table or DataFrame. Missing bars are reported; they are not synthesized,
interpolated, or forward-filled.

## Tests and static checks

```powershell
uv run pytest --cov=market_loader --cov-report=term-missing
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run mypy
```

`docker-compose.test.yaml` provides PostgreSQL and a fast S3-compatible test
service. Final conditional-put, Version ID, encryption, and checksum verification
must still be run against a dedicated development S3 bucket.

Operational recovery is documented in [RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md). The Spring/worker
consumer query is in `db/queries/available_manifest.sql`.
